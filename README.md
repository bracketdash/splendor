# Splendor MARVEL Bot

A bot built to learn how to play Splendor. I happened to have the MARVEL version, so coded to that.

## Trainer (Node App)

Edit the all-caps constants in `src/scripts/trainer.js` to your liking, then:

```bash
npm run trainer
```

## Browser App

Install some stuff:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build and run the production app:

```
